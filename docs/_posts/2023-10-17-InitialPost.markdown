I'm currently 23 years old, soon to be 24. I work a regular job (10 hour days, 4 days a week with no work on Fridays) as a Software Requirements & Design Engineer. To me it seems the world is my oyster, being young, with a decent paying job that will pay for my masters degree which I start in January 2024. With all this in mind, it's easy to get caught up in different mindsets. Whether it's in my work mindset where I feel I need to work as hard as I can to prove my worth to a manager that also feels he needs to work as hard as he can to prove his worth to his manager, who also feels he needs to work as hard as he can to prove his worth to his manager (you get my point). Despite going into this job with a sort of anti-corporation bloated bureaucracy mindset, I've come to realize that the negativity I feel only harms myself. These things are in place for a reason - while not efficient or reaching a high level of effectivity- they're still the outcome of exponential technological progress. This is a topic for another post, I'll stop digressing.

## Intentions

As one can deduct from the first paragraph, lately it's been easy for me to get off focus. Despite this sometimes tumultuous state of mind, there are some *constants* in my mindset that grow; building on eachother and transforming into the next *constant* that maintains the basis of the former. Some may call this wisdom, experience, lessons learned, but for me it seems to be something less abstract. I don't know how to explain this idea yet... Maybe as the culmination of the training data my brain has ingested from the persistent advice of my parents for my entire life, or it's the various characterstics of the people I surround myself with - being closely aligned with the values from the aforementioned training data - on which I run a mental regression to see how it can fit into my preferred living experience. This is why I have doubts on the idea of consciousness because I feel I'm not the only one that prone to major influence of their environemnt (although this influence is not definite) - another topic up for future discussion. The current *constant* that I'm living through: living life intentionally.

A quick over-view of the *constants* I've experienced in the recent years:
  - High School: [NPC](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NPC) Living.
  - 2018-2020: Live life as presently as possible, ensuring I'm making mine and other peoples' lives memorable.
  - 2020-2021: Live life more earnestly/genuine (maybe an effect of living TOO present). Avoiding lying to myself and others (very minor [lies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_lie_(disambiguation)) with no malintent, but still lies).
  - 2021-2022: Live life as earnest, genuine, and present as possible (this is where the compounding of *constants* starts). Focusing on myself and what I want more.
  - 2022-2023: Live life as objectively efficent and effective as possible. This was another notable compounding effect, since I saw it as living maximally earnest, genuine, and present while taking into account the consequences of EVERY one of my actions, as being the best approach to live. This was the most transformative period yet, which makes me question my previous wording due to it being a very eventful year. This may be due for some re-wording.
  - 2023-Present: Life life as intentional as possible. Another culmination of the previous values - noting that my intent is to live life to it's fullest both efficiently effective in an **objective and subjective** sense. It's good to be earnest, but it's also good to be humorous when appropiate. This involves me being honest to myself when I'm doing things that are good or bad and adjusting my future habits/actions accordingly. Examples: Texting back faster, completing my bucket list of chores, being productive at work, reaching out to friends/family, working out, [guilty pleasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use), etc.)

Something worth to notice: my taste of music correlates to these different phases of my living, but that's also a post for another time.

Boiled down, being intentional to me means not going through mindless motions that are popular in contemporary daily life (at least in my economic class). While seemingly mindless, these motions are [deceiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber). With the uproar in general unhappiness and [diagnosed mental health disorders](https://www.search.org/mental-health-records-in-nics-increase-1491-over-the-past-decade/), I can't help but want to fight against the curb. I want to be a good person, and this starts with intentional honesty. Honest objective criticism and praise to my personal and social tendencies seems to be the way. That is assuming that there are [objective truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) in the world, a school of thought in which I am a proponent of.

This blog aligns with my latest *constant* in mindset. I want to be intentional with my thoughts, and what better way to do that than to put them in writing on the internet for anyone to see?
